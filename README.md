# proarm
The proarm is a prosthetic arm which consists of a 6degree of freedom(DOF). The hand consist of a feedback mechanism which sense the touch and the force applied by the prosthetic arm. The feedback mechanism was intedended to give a haptic feedback and light feedback to the user. This helps the user to adjust his holding force by adjusting the emg waves. There are 2 sets of emg sensors attached to the proarm that will capture the emg signals from the user and help to do his daily routine. The prosthetic arm will aid the user to be confident in his day to day life and and he will not be worried about his missing hand.
The GitHub page consist of the emg raw dataset collected for each hold positions. The dataset is used to get an idea regarding the pattern of each hold positions. The dataset gave a better idea regarding the peak value, minimum value and the average value of emg signal for each hold positions. Thus the parameters of the dataset can be used to control the position of the dc motors for each hold positions. However, the emg values will change according to each user. This is the challenge. The project is very basic. No AI or Machine leyis been used. Also the code is also very basic.
